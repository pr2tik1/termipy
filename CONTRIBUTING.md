## Code of Conduct

This project and everyone participating in it is governed by the [TermiPy Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). By participating, you are expected to uphold this code. Please report unacceptable behavior to [maintainer@termipy.com](mailto:pr2tik1@gmail.com).

## Getting Started

- Make sure you have a [GitHub account](https://github.com/signup/free)
- Fork the repository on GitHub
- Clone your fork locally
- Set up the development environment by following the instructions in the [README.md](README.md) file

## How Can I Contribute?

### Reporting Bugs

- Ensure the bug was not already reported by searching on GitHub under [Issues](https://github.com/pr2tik1/termipy/issues)
- If you're unable to find an open issue addressing the problem, [open a new one](https://github.com/pr2tik1/termipy/issues/new). Be sure to include a title and clear description, as much relevant information as possible, and a code sample or an executable test case demonstrating the expected behavior that is not occurring.

### Suggesting Enhancements

- Open a new issue with a clear title and detailed description
- Provide specific examples to demonstrate the steps
- Explain why this enhancement would be useful to most TermiPy users

### Your First Code Contribution

Unsure where to begin contributing to TermiPy? You can start by looking through these `beginner` and `help-wanted` issues:

- [Beginner issues](https://github.com/pr2tik1/termipy/labels/beginner) - issues which should only require a few lines of code, and a test or two.
- [Help wanted issues](https://github.com/pr2tik1/termipy/labels/help%20wanted) - issues which should be a bit more involved than `beginner` issues.

### Pull Requests

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `main`.
2. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests.
3. If you've changed APIs, update the documentation.
4. Ensure the test suite passes.
5. Make sure your code lints.
6. Issue that pull request!

## Style Guidelines

### Git Commit Messages

- Use the present tense ("Add feature" not "Added feature")
- Use the imperative mood ("Move cursor to..." not "Moves cursor to...")
- Limit the first line to 72 characters or less
- Reference issues and pull requests liberally after the first line

### Python Style Guide

This project follows the [PEP 8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/) style guide for Python code. Additionally:

- Use 4 spaces for indentation (not tabs)
- Use docstrings for all public classes, methods, and functions
- Use type hints where appropriate

## Additional Notes

### Issue and Pull Request Labels

This section lists the labels we use to help us track and manage issues and pull requests.

- `bug` - Issues for bugs in the code
- `enhancement` - Issues for new features or improvements
- `documentation` - Issues related to documentation
- `good first issue` - Good for newcomers
- `help wanted` - Extra attention is needed
