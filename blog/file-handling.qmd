## Tips for File Handling

1. Use tab completion to quickly navigate directories and input file names.
2. When dealing with files or directories with spaces in their names, use quotes:

```bash
@termipy >> setwd "My Documents"
```


3. Be cautious when using the `delete` command, as it permanently removes files and directories.
4. Use the `tree` command with a depth parameter to limit the levels shown:

```bash
@termipy >> tree -L 2
```
