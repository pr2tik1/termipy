# Setting Up Environments in TermiPy {.unnumbered}

TermiPy provides commands to easily set up Python and R environments. This guide will walk you through the process of creating and managing these environments.

## Setting Up a Python Environment

TermiPy allows you to create Python virtual environments using the `setpyenv` command.

### Syntax

```bash
setpyenv [name] [version]
```

- `name`: The name of the virtual environment (optional)
- `version`: The Python version to use (optional)


### Examples

1. Create a virtual environment with default name and Python version:


```bash
@termipy >> setpyenv
```

2. Create a virtual environment with a specific name:


```bash
@termipy >> setpyenv myproject
```

3. Create a virtual environment with a specific name and Python version:


```bash
@termipy >> setpyenv myproject 3.9
```

## Setting Up an R Environment

You can initialize an R environment using the `setrenv` command.

### Syntax

```bash
setrenv [name]
```

- `name`: The name of the R environment (optional)


### Example

Create an R environment:

```bash
@termipy >> setrenv myRproject
```

## Managing Environments

Once you've created an environment, you can use standard Python or R commands to manage packages and run scripts within that environment.

### Activating Environments

TermiPy automatically activates the environment upon creation. To switch between environments, you can use the `setwd` command to navigate to the environment's directory.

### Installing Packages

Use pip for Python environments:

```bash
@termipy >> pip install package_name
```

Use install.packages() for R environments:

```bash
@termipy >> R -e "install.packages('package_name')"
```

## Best Practices

1. Use descriptive names for your environments to easily identify their purpose.
2. Create separate environments for different projects to avoid package conflicts.
3. Regularly update your environments to ensure you're using the latest package versions.
4. Document the packages and versions used in your project for reproducibility.


## Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues while setting up environments, make sure:

1. You have the required Python or R versions installed on your system.
2. You have the necessary permissions to create directories and install packages.
3. Your PATH environment variable is correctly set.
4. For R environments, ensure that R is properly installed and accessible from the command line.
